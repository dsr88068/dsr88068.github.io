This week blog we are going to talk about AWS  Elastic Beanstalk. The Elastic Beanstalk is  a comprise of over one hundred services, each of which exposes an area of functionality.With Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without having to learn about the infrastructure that runs those applications. With the Elastic Beanstalk it allows for contorl and  many free choices but at the same time is completely managed. With this  service it can  handle capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring all automatically. For the following applications that it can support is  Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, ,Ruby and others. Then it runs these  with platform version and provisions one or more AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances. IN order to use the this ervices you can interact with this by Elastic Beanstalk console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or eb aCLI designed specifically for Elastic Beanstalk.There is no additional charge for Elastic Beanstalk. You pay only for the underlying AWS resources that your application consumes. <br>

So for the practice lab that I tried it created the the Elastic Beanstalk. When you go the dash board you will click on the Beanstalk servcie. It front you willl be able to tell if the beans talk that was created with green meaning healthy, or red meaning not healthy. Then you can configure the setting  which willl allow to upload your applicaiton, as well configure any EC2 instances aand adjust any loadblancers. This servcie allows for auto scaling for your EC2 instances well. after you have upload you applciaiton you will be able to click on the url link which will  bring up your new web page. <br>

For instance my looked like this! <br>
