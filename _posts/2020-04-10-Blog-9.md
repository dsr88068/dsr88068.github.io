For this week blog I am still working the web page that will display our data from  the RDS. We are still getting this error:

Some the idea I had to fix this error were try to update the packages for php and apache2. Which both of those went successfully but did not resolve the issue. Next I tried to install the mysql packages to see inf that might have something to do with it but just like the other it did not resolve my issue. So now I am looking back at the security groups and the VPC. When looking back at these details I notice that my group decide to use the default VPC to host the EC2. I went ahead to create a new VPC and new security groups to go with it. I made sure to follow all the steps from this article.

 I have gone through all the steps and made sure that everything was correct. The only step that I didnâ€™t need to do was to create the RDS. We have an RDS already created and I can modify certain part of the RDS as far the subnet and security group. I am not sure how to change which VPC it can connect to? I am not sure if this would have any thing to do with my error but its worth a try.
