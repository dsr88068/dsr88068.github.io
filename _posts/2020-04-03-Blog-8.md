This week blog is about how far we come for the project. So we were able to make an RDS in the AWS services which will is be able to connect to the ec2 server which will display our content. The displaying content is simply and will just display the basic data that is in our DB. I had to install apache 2 and the php modules which would allow for the php code to be used. After the modules are installed, I went ahead made sure that the apache2 test page came up. Then I made sure the test info.php displayed correctly. After that I add my php file that I had created which will allow the webpage to connect to the DB and display all the rows and columns that we have updated. This is what I have so far:

After I had uploaded the files and tried to access the webpage it did not work. It gave error that it cannot connect to the MYSQL server which doesn’t make sense.
This is the error:

I think the next step is to check the security permission for the EC2 server and the RDS. I also think that since I didn’t install the MYSQL module for the EC2 Server that could be causing issues. I am going to have to make sure that the html and php code is correct even though I dont think that is the problem.
