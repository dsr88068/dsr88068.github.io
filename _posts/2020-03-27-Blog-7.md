This week blog we are learning about new programs and they interact with each other. These programs Terraform, AWS CLI and Lambda can be used to create/manage the AWS service. Terraform is used for the creation for the service that are in the AWS. For example, Terraform a command line interface can create IAM users, VPC, Subnets and EC2 Instances(servers). The AWS CLI in command line that you can download to your computer which works with Terraform and can provide credentials so that terraform know who account we login in with, what region we are in and what access key we are using. Then Lambda is service in AWS  that can control the  other service by write code so  they can manage those with out you having to do anything. I was able to write a simple helloworld Lambda code which just spit out put for saying the value of 1 is helloworld. I have been researching on to how create the Terraform EC2 instance and found some good article for as well as found some great documentation on subnet for Terraform. This documentation on subnets should me  ow to create different subnets in different subnets zones , while using the Terraform variables. On a good note team commination and effort is going very well.
