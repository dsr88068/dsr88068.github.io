For this week's blog I was able to finish the  ansible lab which was really cool. I like the way it was easy to set up it but  took some minor  configurations. Which in this case I had to research  specific commands. It only took a little research to understand what I had to do for those commands, but it took a lot of research to understand what ansible and how to run it. I think it's a great tool use for projects and especially compared to all the other  automation. It was so awesome the way that I am able to use the shell command each time for unique and specific code. This could make a lot of projects easy to set up an instant. I did start the Prometheus lab which I was able to get to the very end, but had a hiccup when it came to load the nodes. It won't show all of them and it will only  shows the regular Prometheus default metrics. It will not show the new nodes that  were supposed to be installed. I think the reason being is because the way that the node application had stop when I switch over to the Prometheus  which is why it will not show upon the Prometheus  web page. Overall I thought  both labs were intriguing  to work on. I think I need to work on the Prometheus lab a little bit more and ask for help because, I am not sure what to do for the next steps
