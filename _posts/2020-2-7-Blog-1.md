 In this week blog we will be going over the RedShift services presented by AWS. REd Shift is a sa;rge scale data warehoue theat AWS use to allow  dtatbase to be used. It is also used to perform large scale database migrations. IT intend to use SQL based commands and SQL-based clients The data warehouse contains a collection of computing resources called nodes and they are organized as clusters. Each cluster runs its own Redshift engine and contains at least one database. Unfortunaly it does cost $360 a month if one would plan to use as minimal storage as possible.

 To create one of these cluster you must first lofin into your AWS m account. Then got to the services page and look up the RedShift services. Once you have click on  th RedShift dash board you will go launch cluster which then you can fill the informaiton as below.

 The reason why we are choosing to use these small storage for this blog is because of cost. As you can see that we have 320 GB of space but its per node it is 160 GB. it also control the type of Cpu that comes with that node as well. The higher the price the more expensive it will be. Next we will look at the login detail for these nodes.

 For these details it will go over:
 
   Cluster identifier: Example-Name

   Database port: Enter 5439

   Master user name: Example-User-Name

   Master user password: Example-Password

Lastly we will go over the IAM policy if you wish to have  certain permission for this cluster. This it totally optional and the cluster will still work if there is no  IAM policy selected.

From this screen shot we see that you can choose the already created IAM policy or you can creat your that will allow certain permission for this cluster.
After that you can click the create cluster button and in a few moments the cluster gets created.

I did have some toruble trying  to do a sample querry but in the end you need to use the editor button the side of the dash board. This button allows you to connect the cluster that you have created. Once it has establish connection you can create tables, edit tables, and pull querries. It also allow you to add querries if you have allready created them. It can also allows you to connect to the cluster from a different SQL application if that application is permmited.
