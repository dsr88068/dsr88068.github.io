For this week blofg I went ahead and created a VPC for through AWS. A VPC stands for vitrual private cloud which is an on-demand configurable pool of shared computing resources allocated within a public cloud environment. This is used to host many web servers , or to create subnets and other various tools that we use in the real world. It inculdes  frie walls as well for inboud traffic and outbound traffic. Instead of being called firewall setting  AWS refers to this as security group, which allows for  rules to be add to allow different tasks for your VPC  configuration.

 After that I had created the VPC nad created serveal subnets. To be specific I had created  2 public subnets both in different availability zones. Then I had created 2 private subnets  in different availability zones. This so that we vcan have a wide range of space for our servers and clients. After I created the public subnets I made sure that they were connected to the public routing table through the internet gateway. Then I went ahead and made sure that the private subnets were connected  to the priavte routing tabale which would use the NAT gateway. After that i created an EC@ instance to test to make sure that the VPC, security group and routing tables all worked. So when I created this Ec2 instance I made sure to put it in the public subnet in availability zone 2 and attach the security policy which only allow inboud traffic for HTTP from any IP. This was the out come.

 Success!
 The server was running a short script where it downloaded an applicaiton from AWS to show the instance ID and the availability zone.
