For this week's blog I was able to finish the prometheus project and get up and running. I was not  running the server correctly which was given me that errors. The rro before was that the prometheus server  not able to find the nodes installed on the node server . The reasons why was  because, one I didn't not install the node packages on the prometheus server  which would not allow it to run those applications. Two, when I  edit the YML file I didn't do it for the prometheus server which could not locate the node server. Three,  the Node server was not running at the same time at the prometheus serve. Which would be the reason why there was no communication between the two servers. After I had fixed my errors  the the Prometheus server was able to run the node applications on. Other than that for the group project there has been very little communication between the tram, I'm not sure if anyone has started  any work that was assigned to us. I am going to check to see if anything has been created  in the GitHub account and see if anyone has created the esc2 site.  We will know more about this situation next week.
