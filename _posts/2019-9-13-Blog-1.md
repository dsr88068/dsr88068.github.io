In this week's blog  our lab assignment required us to install a lamp stack on our docker station. The Linux Apache MySQL PHP stack was easy to  install for the docker station, I didn't really have a problem being able to run the application on the docker station.  I did run into an issue right before testing application as I needed to install this ( PHP -xml). Which for some reason didn't allow the test application to work. Though after I did install this it was up and running perfectly fine.  I've started to work on the docker file and I have 6 lines of code which I've tried and have worked but I'm not sure how to add edit files that would go into  subfolders. It would be really impressive to have the whole application be installed with just a few simple lines but I am not sure how to enable it.  I saw some people had a sep edit  command, I would have used that if i know what that was. I did think this lab was very fun and I've done LAMP stacks before  but this one seemed to go over very easily compared to my other VM's LAMP Stacks. I hope for the future that I can learn more Docker commands and get more familiar with how these applications and containers will be able to work with our projects because I'm still trying to understand what architect  we are going to use.
