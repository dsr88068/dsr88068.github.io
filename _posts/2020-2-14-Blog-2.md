In this week blog we were intructed to bulid an EC2, EBS, IAM and S3. Along with other detail that I will go over these are the basics for the AWS course. So  in this lab we had to build a start witht he Iam plociy which was prettyu intreseting . I started by createing a new policy and from there I create the role which will allow access for the Ec2 instance to list, get, put, nad snyc with the S3 bucket. The role is created in json nad looked like this :

And make sure to spell you bucket name correctly or else the permisions will be deined for the EC2 instance.
Next I create the EC2 instance which is pretty easy and simple the only thing I did different  is attach the ploicy that I created. After I finished creating the EC2 instance then went ahead and created a volume of to attach to the EC2 instance. That was not the diffcult part, what was diffcult was having the volume formatted in ext4 and then make sure the filesystem mounts correctly. I also made that th volume will attach each time the EC2 boot up.You can tell it work by seeing the second attach volume.

Now we we will ssh in to the EC2 and lastly we will run the command to copy file from the EC2 to the S3 bucket. You can tell it work from the follwing command that are excuted.
