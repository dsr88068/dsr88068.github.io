This weeks blog I have good news to report. Our group was able to finish the project . I was able to create the aws accounts for everyone  and then made the github account to access the repository. I was able to EC2 instance while two of my teammates were able to were able to configure the vpc and the TLS certificate for the EC2 instance. We are also having trouble setting the additional subnets that we need for the VPC. We were also able to connect the Domain name to the server using the route 53. Then another teammate was able to create  anisable play which  we will be able to load onto the server. Through the week all  team members were way better about communication. There was one teammate that ask if they could help but had waited until  the second to last day of when the project was due. Also this specific teammate was not communicating with the team throughout the week. Other than that there was good flow and good communication.  We will see how the next group project goes.
