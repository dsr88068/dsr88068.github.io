This weeks blog we were setting up our practice lab for our project.  In this practice lab we were able to test the VPC,  the EC2 instance  and RDS instance . So we started by making he the VPC which I can post a link on how to  create them:

<br>
<br>
This VPC  will allow the privacy for the   EC2 and the DB. In this tutorial this will show the creation of the public subnets , private subnets and security groups. The use of the security allow for the safety of communication between services. So after we had setup our VPC we went ahead    creatt he security groups:

<br>
<br>
 Now we will be able to create the RDS instance which will host the database.  The database that we decided to go with is MYSQL.  We then started to setup an EC2 that will host the web application which will connect to the DB.  We did have a problem that the EC2 could no connect to the RDS . The problem was solved because the security group for the RDS had to have the IP for the EC2 instance for the inbound rule.
