These past weeks have been interesting consider that I have never used GitHub, Docker or Jekyll. Trying to understand what docker is was a little difficult, but after a few online tutorials I understood how to use and what is it could be used for. I like the idea of how it can deploy as whole operating system within seconds and with all the application already installed. 
The only problem I ran into was if the container was compatible with my host system. GitHub was less confusing since there is so much material to explain how it can be used. But I did have little trouble when I was trying to use GitHub pages since I didnâ€™t understand that a specific respiratory name had to be used. After that, I was able to get to the index page.  Jekyll was not so hard to use, just a lot of content that I could modify. 
So, there was a lot of test and troubleshooting on how to use themes for Jekyll but at the end of the day it was all successful.
