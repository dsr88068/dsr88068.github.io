Halfway through the semester. For this week's blog  i deicde to resach one of the opne souces project presented at scale 17x. Scale 17x last year presentation how a lot of good topics to go over. The one that caught my eye was by this topic about resource management for AWS , Azure, and GCP . This resources management is called Cloud Custodian and it allows for the open source code to work the accounts for AWS , Azure, and GCP. They will be able to target certain resources example would be EBS (EC2).

Other  compatibility would be  encryption , backups, garbage collection , unused resize, off hours, tag compliance, sg compliance, key rotation, and perimeter check.  They also  have AWS IAM management capabilities and works well with Kubernetes. They also plan to add more features to help manage resources for AWS, Azure and GCP.
